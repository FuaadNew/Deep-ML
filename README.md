# Deep-ML: Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains a collection of machine learning exercises and implementations. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of machine learning, from basic linear algebra operations to more complex algorithms.

## Contents

- **Linear Algebra Operations**
  - Matrix-Vector Multiplication (`matrix_dot_vector.py`): Implementation of matrix-vector dot product with input validation
  - Matrix Transposition (`transpose_matrix.py`): Implementation of matrix transposition with type hints and input validation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deep-ML.git
cd Deep-ML
```

2. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended)
